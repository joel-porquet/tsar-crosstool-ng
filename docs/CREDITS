I would like to thank these fine people for making crosstool-NG possible:

  Dan KEGEL, the original author of crosstool: http://www.kegel.com/
    Dan was very helpfull and willing to help when I build my first toolchains.
    I owe him one. Thank you Dan!
    Some crosstool-NG scripts have code snippets coming almost as-is from the
    original work by Dan.

And in order of appearance on the crossgcc ML:

  Allan CLARK for his investigations on building toolchains on MacOS-X.
    Allan made extensive tests of the first alpha of crosstool-NG on his
    MacOS-X, and unveiled some bash-2.05 weirdness.

  Enrico WEIGELT
    - some improvements to the build procedure
    - cxa_atexit disabling for C libraries not supporting it (old uClibc)
    - misc suggestions (restartable build, ...)
    - get rid of some bashisms in ./configure
    - contributed OpenRISC or32 support

  Robert P. J. DAY:
    - some small improvements to the configurator, misc prompting glitches
    - 'sanitised' patches for binutils-2.17
    - patches for glibc-2.5

    - initial support for ARM EABI

  Mark Jonas:
    - initiated Super-H port

  Michael Abbott:
    - make it build with ancient findutils

  Willy Tarreau:
    - a patch to glibc to build on 'ancient' shells
    - reported mis-use of $CT_CC_NATIVE

  Matthias Kaehlcke:
    - fix building glibc-2.7 (and 2.6.1) with newer kernels

  Daniel Dittmann:
    - PowerPC support

  Ioannis E. Venetis:

  Many others have contributed, either in form of patches, suggestions,
  comments, or testing... Thank you to all of you!

Special dedication to the buildroot people for maintaining a set of patches I
happily and shamelessly vampirise from time to time... :-)

More to come as they help.
