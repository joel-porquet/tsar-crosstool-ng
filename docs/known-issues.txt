Glibc does not build: asm/page.h not found

As of linux-2.6.25, asm/page.h is no longer exported.
This means the glibc up to and including 2.6 will not build against headers
exported from linux-2.6.25 and up. Starting with glibc-2.6.1, patches are
available that solves the issue. Switch to at least 2.6.1 if you can, or try
to backport the fix (should be quite easy).

dmalloc does not build

This broken build has been observed for big endian ARM with glibc and NPTL,
and with i686 with glibc and NPTL.

This has not been fully investigated yet. There is a name clash with strdup,
where it is a macro somewhere, and dmalloc tries to re-declare a strdup
function in dmalloc.h, but the declaration is overwritten with the macro
expansion, and thus the build is broken.

The common denominator seems to be NPTL.
