Glibc does not build: asm/page.h not found

As of linux-2.6.25, asm/page.h is no longer exported.
This means the glibc up to and including 2.6 will not build against headers
exported from linux-2.6.25 and up. Starting with glibc-2.6.1, patches are
available that solves the issue. Switch to at least 2.6.1 if you can, or try
to backport the fix (should be quite easy).
