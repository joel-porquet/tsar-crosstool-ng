This files lists the known issues encountered while developping crosstool-NG,
but that could not be addressed before the release.

The file has one section for each known issue, each section containing four
sub-sections: Symptoms, Explanations, Fix, and Workaround.

Each section is separated from the others with a lines of at least 4 dashes.

The following dummy section explains it all.

    --------------------------------
    Symptoms:
      A one-liner of what you would observe.

    Explanations:
      An as much as possible in-depth explanations of the context, why it
      happens, what has been investigated so far, and possible orientations
      as how to try to solve this (eg. URLs, code snippets...).

    Fix:
      What you have to do to fix it, if at all possible.
      The fact that there is a fix, and yet this is a known issue means that
      time to incorporate the fix in crosstool-NG was missing, or planned for
      a future release.

    Workaround:
      What you can do to fix it *temporarily*, if at all possible.
      A workaround is not a real fix, as it can break other parts of
      crosstool-NG, but at least makes you going in your particular case.

So now, on for the real issues...

--------------------------------
Symptoms:
  gcc is not found, although I *do* have gcc installed.

Explanations:
  This is an issue on at least RHEL systems, where gcc is a symlink to ccache.
  Because crosstool-NG create links to gcc for the build and host environment,
  those symlinks are in fact pointing to ccache, which then doesn't know how
  to run the compiler.

  A possible fix could probably set the environment variable CCACHE_CC to the
  actual compiler used.

Fix:
  None known.

Workaround:
  Uninstall ccache.

--------------------------------
Symptoms:
  The extract and/or path steps fail under Cygwin.

Explanations:
  This is not related to crosstool-NG. Mounts under Cygwin are by default not
  case-sensitive. You have to use so-called "managed" mounts. See:
  http://cygwin.com/faq.html section 4, question 32.

Fix:
  Use "managed" mounts for the directories where you build *and* install your
  toolchains.

Workaround:
  None.

--------------------------------
Symptoms:
  uClibc fails to build under Cygwin.

Explanations:
  With uClibc, it is possible to build a cross-ldd. Unfortunately, it is
  not (currently) possible to build this cross-ldd under Cygwin.

Fix:
  None so far.

Workaround:
  Disable the cross-ldd build.
