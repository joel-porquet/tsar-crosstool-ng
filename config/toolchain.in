config USE_SYSROOT
    bool
    prompt "Use sysroot'ed toolchain"
    default y
    help
      Use the 'shinny new' sysroot feature of gcc: libraries split between
      prefix/target/sys-root/lib and prefix/target/sys-root/usr/lib
      
      You definitely want to say 'Y' here. Yes you do. I know you do. Say 'Y'.

config SHARED_LIBS
    bool
    prompt "Build shared libraries"
    default y
    help
      Say 'y' here, unless you don't want shared libraries.
      
      You might not want shared librries if you're building for a target that
      don't support it (maybe some nommu targets, for example, or bare metal).

config TARGET_VENDOR
    string
    prompt "Vendor string"
    default "unknown"
    help
      Vendor part of the target tuple.
      
      A tuple is of the form arch-vendor-kernel-system.
      You can set the second part, vendor, to whatever you see fit.
      Use a single word, or use underscores "_" to separate words.
      
      Keep the default (unkown) if you don't know better.

config TARGET_ALIAS_SED_EXPR
    string
    prompt "Target sed transform"
    default ""
    help
      Normaly, you'd call your toolchain components (especially gcc) by
      prefixing the target tuple followed by a dash and the component name
      (eg. armeb-unknown-linux-uclibc-gcc).
      
      You can enter here a sed expression to be applied to ${CT_TARGET} to
      create an alias for your toolchain.
      
      For example, "s/${CT_TARGET_VENDOR}/foobar/" (without the double quotes)
      will create the armeb-foobar-linux-uclibc alias to the above-mentioned
      toolchain.
      
      You shouldn't need to enter anything here, unless you plan to manually
      call the tools (autotools-based ./configure will use the standard name).

config TARGET_ALIAS
    string
    prompt "Target alias"
    default ""
    help
      Normaly, you'd call your toolchain components (especially gcc) by
      prefixing the target tuple followed by a dash and the component name
      (eg. armeb-unknown-linux-uclibc-gcc).
      
      You can enter a shortcut here. This string will be used to create
      symbolic links to the toolchain tools (eg. if you enter "foo-bar" here,
      then gcc for your toolchain will also be available as "foo-bar-gcc" along
      with the original name).
      
      You shouldn't need to enter anything here, unless you plan to manually
      call the tools (autotools-based ./configure will use the standard name).

      You should leave empty, unless you really now what you're doing.

      The native C compiler.
      
      You can set this to an alternative compiler if you have more than one
      installed (eg. gcc is gcc-4.1.1 and you want to use gcc-3.4.6).
      
      You can leave this empty as well, in which case gcc will be used.
