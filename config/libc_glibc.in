      Extra flags to pass gcc when building glibc.

      to be passed onto gcc.

      Some architectures need to set options in the file configparms.
      This is the case for sh3/4, which really need to set configparms as of
      gcc-3.4/glibc-2.3.2.

      Unless you are building a toolchain for sh3/4, you should leave that empty.

      Note: this is awkward, doesn't work well if you need more than one
            line in configparms

config LIBC_GLIBC_USE_PORTS
    bool
    prompt "Use the ports addon"
    default n
    help
      The ports addon contains some architecture ports that are not available
      in the official glibc distribution.
      
      For example, this is the case for ARM with glibc >= 2.4
      
      Say n only if you're sure that your architecture is in the official
      glibc distribution for your chosen version.

      include in your C library.

config LIBC_ADDONS_LIST
    string

    default ""
    depends on LIBC_ADDONS
    help
      Extra addons to include in glibc. Space separated list.

      You need to specify neither linuxthreads nor nptl, as they are added
      automagically for you depending on the threading model you choosed
      earlier.
      
      Eg.: crypt        (for very old glibces)
