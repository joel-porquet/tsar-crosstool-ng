      It is highly recommended to check the newly built MPC library.
      Unfortunately, this is a very intensive task, and takes a loooong time.

      Checking MPC is thus disabled by default.

      If you suspect that your MPC library is the cause for incorrectly
      generated code, you should answer 'Y' here.
