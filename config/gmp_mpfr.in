      Recent gcc needs both GMP and MPFR to build some frontends.

      Say 'Y' here if you want to build those two libraries specifically
      for crosstool-NG.

      The packages that can use GMP and MPFR are:
        - binutils
        - gcc
        - gdb

config GMP_MPFR_TARGET
    bool
    prompt "Build libraries for the target"
    depends on GMP_MPFR
    depends on ! BARE_METAL
    default n
    help
      Also build libraries for the target. This can be usefull if you want
      to later build a compiler that will run on the target, or if you want
      to run gdb natively on the target.
