config LOCAL_TARBALLS_DIR
    string
    prompt "Local tarballs directory"
    default ""
    help
      If you have previously downloaded the tarballs, enter the PATH where
      you stored them here.

config SAVE_TARBALLS
    bool
    prompt "Save new tarballs"
    default n
    depends on LOCAL_TARBALLS_DIR != ""
    help
      If you say 'y' here, new downloaded tarballs will be saved in the
      directory you entered above.

config PREFIX_DIR
    string
    prompt "Prefix directory"
    default "${HOME}/${CT_TARGET}"
    help
      This is the path the toolchain will run from.

config INSTALL_DIR
    string
#    prompt "Install directory"
    default "${CT_PREFIX_DIR}"
#    help
#      This is the path the target will be installed into.
#      
#      Normally, you would set this to ${CT_PREFIX_DIR}, but if for some reasons
#      you can't write there, you can install somewhere else and have a third
#      person do the install for you.
#      The reason you might also want to install elsewhere is if you are going
#      to package your shinny new toolchain for distribution.

    prompt "Use custom patch directory"
    default n
    help
      If you have custom patches that you want to be applied, say 'Y' here and

    default n
    depends on CUSTOM_PATCH
    help
      Don't apply patches coming with crosstool-NG, only those patches available

      If you say 'N' here, then the patches provided with crosstool-NG will be
      applied first, and then your patches.
