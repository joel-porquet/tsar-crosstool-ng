        There are two versions of linuxthreads.  The older (stable) version
        has been in uClibc for quite a long time but hasn't seen too many
        updates other than bugfixes.

    prompt "new"
    help
      From the uClibc config option help:
        The new version has not been tested much, and lacks ports for arches
        which glibc does not support (like bfin/frv/etc...), but is based on
        the latest code from glibc, so it may be the only choice for the
        newer ports (like alpha/amd64/64bit arches and hppa).
