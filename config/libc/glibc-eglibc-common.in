# This file contains the common configuration options
# that apply to both glibc and eglibc.

# Please note:
# the symlink is a hack around the fact that mconf can not parse
# the same file more than once, and errors out if it is the case.
# If mconf is updated to accept multiple inclusion of the same
# file, then the symlink can go (and the includers be updated).

config LIBC_GLIBC_EXTRA_CONFIG
    string
    prompt "extra config"
    default ""
    help
      Extra flags to pass onto ./configure when configuring.

      Eg.: --enable-static-nss

config LIBC_GLIBC_EXTRA_CFLAGS
    string
    prompt "extra target CFLAGS"
    default ""
    help
      Extra target CFLAGS to use when building.

config LIBC_EXTRA_CC_ARGS
    string
    prompt "gcc extra flags"
    default ""
    help
      Extra flags to pass gcc when building.

      Seldom used, except for sparc64 which seems to need the flag -64
      to be passed onto gcc.

config LIBC_GLIBC_USE_PORTS
    bool
    prompt "Use the ports addon"
    default n
    help
      The ports addon contains some architecture ports that are not available
      in the official distribution.

      For example, this is the case for ARM with for 2.4 and above.

      Say n only if you're sure that your architecture is in the official
      distribution for your chosen version.

config LIBC_ADDONS
    bool
    prompt "Pass extra addons list"
    default n
    help
      If you say Y here, you'll be able to give the list of addons you want to
      include in your C library.

config LIBC_ADDONS_LIST
    string
    prompt "Extra addons"
    default ""
    depends on LIBC_ADDONS
    help
      Extra addons to include. Space separated list.

      You need to specify neither linuxthreads nor nptl, as they are added
      automagically for you depending on the threading model you choosed
      earlier.

      Eg.: crypt        (for very old libces)
