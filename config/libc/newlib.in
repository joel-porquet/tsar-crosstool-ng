    help
    Newlib is a C library intended for use on embedded systems. It is a 
    conglomeration of several library parts, all under free software 
    licenses that make them easily usable on embedded products. Newlib 
    is only available in source form. It can be compiled for a wide 
    array of processors, and will usually work on any architecture with
    the addition of a few low-level routines.
