      Only the http and ftp protocols will be tunneled through this
      proxy.

      Use a Socks 4/5 proxy to connect to the internet.
      All protocols can get tunneled through this kind of proxy (your
      proxy configuration may not allow all protocols, but chances are
      that protocols needed by crosstool-NG are allowed).
      
      Alternatively to setting this option, you can configure tsocks
      system-wide, and set and export the following variable in your
      environment:
        LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/your/tsocks-library.so
      
      This option makes use of the tsocks library. You will have to have tsocks
      installed on your system, of course.
      
      If you think you do not know what tsocks is, or how to configure it,
      chances are that you do not need to set this option.

      Tarballs will be be preferably fetched from the LAN mirror, and if
      not found there, standard places will be searched for.
      
      Obviously, nothing prevents you from using a mirror that is in fact
      *not* on your LAN, for example on another subnet of your company's
      network, or a mirror on the Internet.

      This is the base directory searched for for tarballs. If you enter

      on the server:
        /mirror/<name>/
        /mirror/

      has a ls-lr.gz (or similar) file, and use that file to see if the
      tarball is listed somewhere in that file.
      
      Common file names looked for are:
        ls-lrRt.txt     (used at ftp.gnu.org)
        find.txt        (ditto)

config CONNECT_TIMEOUT

    help
      From the curl manual:
        Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take.
      
      The scenario is as follows;
        - some enterprise networks have firewalls that prohibit FTP traffic, while
          still allowing HTTP
        - most download sites have http:// equivalent for the ftp:// URL
        - after this number of seconds, it is considered that the connection could
          not be established, and the next URL in the list is tried, until we reach
          an URL that will go through the firewall, most probably an http:// URL.
      
      If you have a slow network, you'd better set this value higher than the default
      10s. If you know a firewall is blocking connections, but your network is globally
      fast, you can try to lower this value to jump more quickly to allowed URLs. YMMV.
      
      Note that this value applies equally to wget if you have that installed.
      
      Of course, you'd be better off to use a proxy, as offered by the previous
      option.
