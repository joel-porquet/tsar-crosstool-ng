comment "Build behavior"

config PARALLEL_JOBS
    int
    prompt "Number of parallel jobs"
    default 1
    help
      Number of jobs make will be allowed to run concurently.
      Set this higher than the number of processors you have, but not too high.
      A good rule of thumb is twice the number of processors you have.
      
      Enter 1 (or 0) to have only one job at a time.

config LOAD
    int
    prompt "Maximum allowed load"
    default 0
    help
      Specifies that no new jobs should be started if there are others jobs
      running and the load average is at least this value.
      
      Makes sense on SMP machines only.
      
      Enter 0 to have no limit on the load average.
      
      Note: only the integer part of the load is allowed here (you can't enter
            0.75 for example).

config NICE
    int
    prompt "Nice level"
    default 0
    range 0 19
    help
      Renices the build process up.

config USE_PIPES
    bool
    prompt "Use -pipe"
    default y
    help
      Use gcc's option -pipe to use pipes rather than temp files when building
      the toolchain.

choice
    bool
    prompt "Shell to use as CONFIG_SHELL"
    default CONFIG_SHELL_SYSTEM

config CONFIG_SHELL_SH
    bool
    prompt "sh (the system shell)"
    help
      Use 'sh' as CONFIG_SHELL.
      
      ./configure scripts and Makefiles make intensive use of calling
      sub-shells. This is usually done by calling /bin/sh. /bin/sh ought
      to be an at-least-POSIX-conformant shell (that is, able to interpret
      POSIX shell scripts).
      
      On many (most?) systems, /bin/sh is a symlink to bash. On some other
      systems (eg. Ubuntu, latest Debian), /bin/sh points to dash (or ash).
      bash is a full-featured shell, with many extension to POSIX, but is
      quite slow (see ection BUGS in the bash man page), while dash is
      faster, with very few extensions to POSIX.  On the other hand, some
      ./configure scripts, although written to use /bin/sh, may really
      require to be run by bash.
      
      The default is to use your system's /bin/sh shell. If you want to
      run faster, you can select to use dash. If you have problems with
      either the system shell or when using dash, then you can force to
      use bash.
      
config CONFIG_SHELL_ASH
    bool
    prompt "ash"
    help
      Use 'ash' as CONFIG_SHELL.
      
      See help for CONFIG_SHELL_SH, above, for more explanations.
