comment "Extracting"

config FORCE_EXTRACT
    bool
    prompt "Force extractions"
    default n
    help
      Force extraction of already exctracted tarballs.
      
      Usefull if you suspect a previous extract did not complete (eg. broken
      tarball), or you added a new set of patches for this component.

config OVERIDE_CONFIG_GUESS_SUB
    bool
    prompt "Override config.{guess,sub}"
    default y
    help
      Override tools' versions of config.guess and config.sub with the ones
      from crosstool-NG. This means that all instances of config.guess and
      config.sub in gcc, binutils, glibc, etc... will be replaced.

      Most of the time, the versions of those scripts found in packages are old
      versions, thus lacking some target definitions. This is the case for
      uClibc-based tuples in old versions of gcc and gdb, for example.

      Also, doing so will guarantee that all components have the same tuples
      definitions for your target, and not diverging ones.

      You can update the ones provided with crosstool-NG by first running:
        ct-ng updatetools
      in the directory where you want to run crosstool-NG prior to the build.

config ONLY_EXTRACT
    bool
    prompt "Stop after extracting tarballs"
    default n
    help
      Exit after unpacking and patching tarballs.
      
      Usefull to look at the code before doing the build itself.
