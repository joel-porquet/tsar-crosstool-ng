      Pass --enable-target-optspace to crossgcc's configure.
      
      This will compile crossgcc's libs with -Os.

      If you get the missing symbol "__cxa_atexit" when building C++ programs,
      you might want to try disabling this option.

      Say 'y' here to not use Pre-Compiled Headers in the resulting toolchain.
      at the expense of speed when compiling C++ code.
      
      For some configurations (most notably canadian?), PCH are broken, and
      need to be disabled. Please see:

    help
      'sjlj' is short for setjmp/longjmp.
      
      On some architectures, stack unwinding during exception handling
      works perfectly well without using sjlj, while on some others,
      use of sjlj is required for proper stack unwinding.
      
       Option  | sjlj use           | Associated ./configure switch
      ---------+--------------------+--------------------------------
         Y     | forcibly used      | --enable-sjlj-exceptions
         M     | auto               | (none, ./configure decides)
         N     | forcibly not used  | --disable-sjlj-exceptions
      
      It should be safe to say 'M' or 'N'.
      
      It can happen that ./configure is wrong in some cases. Known
      case is for ARM big endian, where you should say 'N'.
