      gcc 4.3.0 and above requires both GMP and MPFR to build some frontends,
      and some other components can use them as well.
      
      These will be automatically selected if you choose gcc>=4.3.0, but you
      can say 'Y' here if you want to build those two libraries for the other
      components (that don't select them by default).
      
      The packages that can use GMP and MPFR are:
        - binutils
        - gcc
        - gdb

      Also build libraries for the target. This can be usefull if you want
      to later build a compiler that will run on the target, or if you want
      to run gdb natively on the target.

      gcc-4.4.0 and above requires PPL and CLooG/PPL to build some parts
      of the optimiser (GRAPHITE loop optimisation, to be precise).
      
      In addition to those, gcc-4.4 also optionally uses MPC to enable
      additional optimisations on complex numbers. Although MPC is optional,
      crosstool-NG requires it and uses it to build gcc >= 4.4.0.
      
      These will be automatically selected if you choose gcc>=4.4.0, but you
      can say 'Y' here, although it is unknown yet if any other component
      can use them.
