      gcc 4.3.0 and above requires both GMP and MPFR to build some frontends,
      and some other components can use them as well (eg. binutils and gdb).
      
      Say 'Y' here if you want to build those two libraries specifically
      for crosstool-NG.
      
      The packages that can use GMP and MPFR are:
        - binutils
        - gcc
        - gdb

      Also build libraries for the target. This can be usefull if you want
      to later build a compiler that will run on the target, or if you want
      to run gdb natively on the target.
