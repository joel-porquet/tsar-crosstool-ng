      A static cross gdb can be usefull if you debug on a machine that is
      not the one that is used to compile the toolchain.
      
      That way, you can share the cross-gdb without installing a toolchain
      on every machine that will be used to debug target programs.

      gdb can use GMP+MPFR, although it does not seem compulsory.
      
      Say 'Y' here if you want to use GMP+MPFR.
