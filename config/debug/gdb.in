    help
      A static cross gdb can be usefull if you debug on a machine that is
      not the one that is used to compile the toolchain.

      That way, you can share the cross-gdb without installing a toolchain
      on every machine that will be used to debug target programs.

    help
      In case you have trouble with dynamic loading of shared libraries,
      you will find that a static gdb comes in handy.

    help
      gdb can make use of the GMP and MPFR libraries.

      While the cross-gdb (above) can use the libraries compiled for the
      host, the native gdb needs the libraries for the target (where it will
      eventually run).

      Setting this option will force building the GMP and MPFR libraries for
      the target, and configure the native gdb to use them.

config GDB_GDBSERVER
