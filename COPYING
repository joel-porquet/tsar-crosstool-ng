- Files found in patches/*/ are available under the same license as the
  upstream software they apply to.

  That means that you can't use those patches if you were licensed the
  software under a specific license which is not the one the software is
  commonly available under.

  As an example, if you ever managed to get the Linux kernel under a license
  other than the GPLv2, you are not allowed to use the Linux kernel patches
  coming with crosstool-NG, as those are available under the GPLv2, which is
  the license the Linux kernel is most commonly available under.

  As a convenience, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1 (for the
  glibc, uClibc, and some other libraries) is available there:

  individual license specified in the file itself, or an accompanying file,
