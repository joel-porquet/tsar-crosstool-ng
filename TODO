This is a somewhat ordered TODO list:

Recuring tasks:

- update versions for every tools...



Non-recurring:

- gcc-4.4
  - requires some companion libs:
    - PPL
    - CLooG
    - MPC
  - check that the patchset from 4.3.3 still applies
  - commonalise the companion library check box: check-all-or-check-none (?)

- uClinux

- add newlib (for enhanced bare metal)
  - may need heavy tweaks and bends in gcc.sh
  - try to make it generic, will help for uClibc++
  - check whether it supports running under uClinux

- uClibc++
  - see newlib, above

- Cygwin target (needs newlib)
  - so we can complie for Windows/Cygwin

- mingw32 target
  - so we can compile for Windows/Win32

- mingw32 host
  - so we can run natively under Windows/Win32 (without requiring Cygwin)

- eglibc config file
  - see: http://sourceware.org/ml/crossgcc/2009-05/msg00022.html

- multilib
