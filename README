This is the README for crosstool-NG

To get you started, just enter:
  ./configure --help

You can find a (terse and WIP) documentation in docs/overview.txt.

You can also point your browser to
  http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/crosstool

If you want to enhance crosstool-NG, there's a to-do list in the TODO file.

If you need to send a bug report or a patch, please send a mail with subject
prefixed with "[CT_NG]" with the following destinations:
    TO: yann.morin.1998 (at) anciens.enib.fr
    CC: crossgcc (at) sourceware.org

Patches should come with the appropriate SoB line. A SoB line is typically
something like:
  Signed-off-by: John DOE <john.doe@somewhere.net>

The SoB line is clearly described in Documentation/SubmittingPatches , section
12, of your favourite Linux kernel source tree.

The people that helped are listed in docs/CREDITS. Many thanks to them! :-)

The list of known issues is listed in docs/known-issues.txt.

Aloha!
