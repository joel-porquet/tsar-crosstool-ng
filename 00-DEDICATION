In memoriam: Cédric DUVAL.

This release is dedicated to my good friend, Cédric, who passed
away in late September 2011, after a long and stressful struggle
against the disease.

Cédric was always prompt to discuss any subject. He was open-minded,
and every thing on Earth was of interest to him; Free Software, and
Freedom in general, was one of those interests we used to discuss
about most. He and I had many a good talk about so many things, and
I learned so much from him.

Cédric leaves behind him loving and dismayed girl friend and father
and mother, and countless saddened friends; we will all dearly miss
him.

Do not forget your towel, Cédric.
So long, and thanks for all the fish!
