I would like to thank these fine people for making crosstool-NG possible:

  Dan KEGEL, the original author of crosstool: http://www.kegel.com/
    Dan was very helpfull and willing to help when I build my first toolchains.
    I owe him one. Thank you Dan!
    Some crosstool-NG scripts have code snippets coming almost as-is from the
    original work by Dan.

More to come as they help.
