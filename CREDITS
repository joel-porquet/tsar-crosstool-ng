I would like to thank these fine people for making crosstool-NG possible:

  Dan KEGEL, the original author of crosstool: http://www.kegel.com/
    Dan was very helpfull and willing to help when I build my first toolchains.
    I owe him one. Thank you Dan!
    Some crosstool-NG scripts have code snippets coming almost as-is from the
    original work by Dan.

  Allan CLARK for his investigations on building toolchains on MacOS-X.
    Allan made extensive tests of the first alpha of ct-ng on his MacOS-X
    and unveiled some bash-2.05 weirdness.

  Enrico WEIGELT for some improvements of the build procedure:
    - cxa_atexit disabling for C libraries not supporting it (uClibc)

More to come as they help.
